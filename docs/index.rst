Welcome to MLSpace!
===================================

MLSpace is a no-hassle tool for data science, machine learning and deep learning.

MLSpace has pre-made environments for pytorch, tensorflow and everything else you might need.
All environments come with VSCode (code-server) and JupyterLab. You no longer need to care about CUDA/cuDNN versions!

Setting up MLSpace is a three step process:
   - installation
   - set up
   - create and run environments
